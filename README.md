# Getting Started

To test the example

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Sid-Bhatia-0/SimpleIMGUI.jl.git
```

1. Go to the `examples` directory and run the julia REPL

```
julia --project=.
```

1. Instantiate the project after going into `Pkg` mode

```
(examples) pkg> instantiate
```

1. Exit the REPL and run `example.jl` with the Project.toml and Manifest.toml files in the `examples` directory
