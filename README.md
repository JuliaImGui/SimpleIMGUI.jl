# SimpleIMGUI

This package is under development.

# Getting Started

To test an example, first clone the repository and then execute the following command inside the `examples` directory of the cloned repository:

```
julia --project=. -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.develop(path="../../SimpleIMGUI.jl"); Pkg.instantiate(); include("example.jl")'
```

This will open a window and you can interact with the widgets present in it. Here is an example (note that the screenshot might not be up to date with `example.jl`):
